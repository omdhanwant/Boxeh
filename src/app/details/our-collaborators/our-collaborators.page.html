              Entrepreneurs who have proven their ability to innovate
              Her Majesty King Abdullah bin Al Hussein </p>

            <p>
              The potential for entrepreneurship in Jordan and the region is high. Local entrepreneurs have demonstrated
              they are increasingly innovative in devising ways to tackle the evolving societal challenges with novel
              applications of technology. In fact, 27% of the 100 start-ups shaping the future of the Arab World are
              based in Jordan.</p>
            <p>

              What’s more, the Arab World is experiencing a startling growth in both the number of successful startups
              and the amount of investment funding available to them. According to a report released ahead of the World
              Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa, $900 million was invested across the region in funding
              start-ups in 2018, that is a 31% increase in total funding from 2017.</p>
            <p>

              In the $8.3 billion e-commerce sector in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena), it is the e-grocery
              segment that has perhaps experienced the most amount of disruption. But for the kitchen-savvy who crave
              simple meal preparation without sacrificing quality or convenience, there is an untapped opportunity in
              the meal kit industry (worth over $1.5 billion globally) that’s begging for venture firms to put more
              cooks in the kitchen.
