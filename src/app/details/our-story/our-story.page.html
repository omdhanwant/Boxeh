<h4><span style="color: #91c11e;">It all started whenâ€¦</span></h4>
<p>Our founder Sahar was pursuing her MBA in the United Kingdom and was hooked on meal kit delivery services that allowed her to create wholesome meals at home while saving hours on grocery shopping and meal prep. That's when she found herself falling in love with cooking in a whole new way.</p>
<p>Upon her return to Amman, Sahar's desire to share her newfound passion for hassle-free cooking inspired her to build Boxeh to enable people to cook great meals at home without all the extra work.</p>
<p>In her own words, Sahar believes " the only thing that beats a delicious home-cooked meal is one that is prepared conveniently."</p>
